#### Evelyn Underhill, "Mysticism: A Study in Nature and Development of Spiritual Consciousness," Pantianos Classics, 2020, 12th revised edition.

> "We are driven to the conclusion that if the theory of evolution is to include or explain the facts of artistic an spiritual experience -- and it cannot be accepted by any serious thinker if these great tracts of consciousness remain outside its range -- it must e rebuilt on a mental rather than a physical basis." (pp. 13-14)

> "Even the most ordinary human life includes in its range fundamental experiences...forced on us as it were against our will, for which science finds it hard to account. These experiences and sensations, and the hours of exalted emotion which they bring with them...fulfil [sic] no office in relation to her pet 'functions of nutrition and reproduction.'" (p. 14)

> "Yet the 'unconscious' after all is merely a convenient name for the aggregate of those powers, parts, or qualities of the whole self which at any given moment are not conscious, or that the Ego is not conscious of. Included in the unconscious region of an average healthy man are all those automatic activities by which the life of the body is carried on: all those 'uncivilized' instincts and vices, those remains of the ancestral savage, which education has forced out of the stream of consciousness and which now only send their messages to the surface in a carefully disguised form." (p. 29)
