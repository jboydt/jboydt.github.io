#### G.K. Chesterton, "Orthodoxy: The Romance of Faith," Image Books, 1990.

> "The materialist is sure that history has been simply and solely a chain of causation, just as the interesting person before mentioned is quite sure that he is simply and solely a chicken. Materialists and madmen never have doubts." (p. 24)

> "...what actually is the chief mark and element of insanity; we may say in summary that it is reason used without root, reason in the void." (p. 27)

> "...one set of thinkers can in some degree prevent further thinking by teaching the next generation that there is no validity in any human thought. ... Reason is itself a matter of faith. It is an act of faith to assert that our thoughts have any relation to reality at all." (p. 33)

> "Not only is suicide a sin, it is the sin. It is the ultimate and absolute evil, the refusal to take an interest in existence; the refusal to take the oath of loyalty to life." (p. 72)

> "One rationalist had hardly done calling Christianity a nightmare before another began to call it a fools paradise. ... Christianity could not at once be the black mask on a white world, and also the white mask on a black world." (p. 85)
