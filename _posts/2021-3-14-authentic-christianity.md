#### Gene Edward Veith Jr. and A. Trevor Sutton, "Authentic Christianity: How Lutheran Theology Speaks to a Postmodern World," Concordia Publishing House, 2017.

> "...even the most hardened secularists, those who reject the very possibility of moral truth, are constantly making moral judgments: they demand social justice, denounce political evils, demonstrate for human rights, call for ethical approaches to the environment, and criticize bad behavior whenever they see it. Biblical morality, especially when it has to do with sex, seems to carry little weight today, though the outrage at sexual harassment, nonconsensual sex, and other violations shows that sex is still fraught with moral significance." (p. 83)

> Alister McGrath: "Far from regarding suffering or evil as a nonsensical intrusion into the world (which Luther regards as the opinion of a 'theologian of glory'), the 'theologian of the cross' regards such suffering as his most precious treasure, for revealed and yet hidden in precisely such sufferings is non other than the Living God, working out the salvation of those whom he loves." (p. 113)

> John Kleinig: "We are not called to become more spiritual by disengaging from our earthly life, but simply to rely on Jesus as we do what is given for us to do, experience what is given for us to experience, and enjoy what is given for us t. enjoy." (p. 217)
