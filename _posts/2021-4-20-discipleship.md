#### Dietrich Bonhoeffer, "Discipleship," Fortress Press, 2015.

> "When ethical conflict is taken so seriously that it tortures and subjugates people because it hinders their doing the liberating act of obedience, then it is revealed in its full godlessness as complete disobedience in all its insincerity." (p. 34)

> "Forgiving sins is the Christ-suffering required of his disciples. It is required of all Christians." (p. 54)

> "In fact, the distinction between private and official is vulnerable to an insoluble dilemma. Where in real life am I really only a private person and where only the bearer of my office?" (p. 105)

> "Baptism incorporates us as members into the unity of the body of Christ. The Lord's Supper keeps us in this community with Christ's body." (p. 197)
