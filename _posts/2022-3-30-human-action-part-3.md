#### Ludwig von Mises, "Human Action: A Treatise on Economics (Part Three)", The Mises Institute, 2020.

> "It is questionable whether or not prices were less changeable in those older days. On the contrary, it could rather be asserted that the merger of local markets into larger national markets, the final emergence of a world embracing world market, and the evolution of commerce aiming at continuously supplying the consumers have made price changes less frequent and less sharp." (p. 219)
