#### Huston Smith, "Why Religion Matters," HarperOne, 2001.

> "In different ways, the East and the West are going through a single common crisis whose cause is the spiritual condition of the modern world. That condition is characterized by loss--the loss of religious certainties and of transcendence with its larger horizons." (p. 1)

> "Having been created in the _imago Dei_, the image of God, all human beings have a God-shaped vacuum built into their hearts. Since nature abhors a vacuum, people keep trying to fill the one inside them." (p. 148)

> "To begin with the West, Progress has turned into something of a nightmare. The campaign against ignorance has expanded our knowledge of nature, but science cannot tell us what we should give our lives to." (p. 152)
