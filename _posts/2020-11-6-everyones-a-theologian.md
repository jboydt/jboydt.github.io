#### R.C. Sproul, "Everyone's a Theologian: An Introduction to Sytematic Theology," Reformation Trust Publishing, 2014.

> "Over the last two centuries, liberal theology, with its categorical rejection of the inspiration and authority of the Bible, has had such an impact on the visible church as to almost destroy it... This is largely due to the abandonment of Apostolic authority in favor of a focus on social concerns, making the church indistinguishable from any number of other institutions." (p. 272)
