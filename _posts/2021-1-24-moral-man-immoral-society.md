#### Reinhold Niebuhr, "Moral Man and Immoral Society," Charles Scribner's Sons, 1960.

> "The relations between groups must therefore always be predominantly political rather than ethical, that is, they will be determined by the proportion of power which each group possesses at least as much as by any rational and moral appraisal of the comparative needs and claims of each group." (p. xxiii)

> "...minorities will yield only because the majority has come into control of the police power of the state and may, if the occasion arises, augment that power by its own military strength." (p. 5)

> "Without the ultrarational hopes and passions of religion no society will ever have the courage to conquer despair and attempt the impossible; for the vision of a just society is an impossible one, which can be approximated only by those who do not regard it as impossible." (p. 81)
