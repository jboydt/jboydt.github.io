#### A.W. Tozer, "The Pursuit of God," Christian Publications, Inc., 1982.

> "The tragic results of this spirit are all about us. Shallow lives, hollow religious philosophies, the preponderance of the element of fun in gospel meetings, the glorification of men, trust in religious externalities, quasi-religious fellowships, salesmanship methods, the mistaking of dynamic personality for the power of the Spirit. These and such as these are the symptoms of an evil disease, a deep and serious malady of the soul." (p. 69)

> "We must of necessity be servant to someone, either to God or to sin. The sinner prides himself on his independence, completely overlooking the fact that he is the weak slave of the sins that rule his members." (p. 104)

> "God was our original habitat and our hearts cannot but feel at home when they enter again that ancient and beautiful abode." (p. 104)
