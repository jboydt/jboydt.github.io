#### Paul Tillich, "Love, Power and Justice," Oxford University Press, 1960.

> "Unperverted life strives for that of which it is in want, it strives for union with that which is separated from it, though it belongs to it." (p. 29)

> "In the moment in which the representatives of the centre use the power of the whole for their particular self-realization they cease to be the actual centre, and the whole being, without a centre, disintegrates." (p. 45)

> "Justice is always violated if men are dealt with as if they were things." (p. 60)

> "Forgiving love is the only way of fulfilling the intrinsic claim in every being, namely its claim to be reaccepted into the unit to which it belongs." (p. 86)
